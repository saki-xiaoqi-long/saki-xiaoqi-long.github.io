# Intro

I am a JD Candidate at Yale Law School and summer associate at Fish & Richardson P.C. specializing in intellectual property. Beyond my primary focus, I am actively involved in pro bono fieldwork addressing Gender Violence and Title IX issues. Academically, I have a keen interest in law and economics, tax law and redistributive justice, and comparative law.
